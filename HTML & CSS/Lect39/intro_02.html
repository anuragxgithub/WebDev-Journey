    <!-- NOTE:
    here we will talk about the CSS Grid
    -- This is also used to design the layout like flexbox but here we can easily design 2D layout (length and breadth easily manageable). 
    -- In flexbox we can also desing 2d layout but we have to write more code as well as use more brain
    So lets first draw a basic 2D layout using flexbox and after that we will draw it using grid
